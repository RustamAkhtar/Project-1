<h2>Bedwars</h2>

<p>Bedwars is a fun game that can be found in Minecraft or Roblox. The game was originally made by Minecraft but was copied in a different way by Roblox. I like the Roblox version and started playing in season 2 a few months after the game was created. Roblox Bedwars is a game with many kits and every week 4  random kits are free.</p>
